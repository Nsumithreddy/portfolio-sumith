About This Project

This project is more than just a resume; it's a practical demonstration of my ability to build a modern, mobile-first website from the ground up. I designed it to be clean, fast, and a true representation of my personal brand: the intersection of clean design and data-driven solutions.

🛠️ Tech Stack

This site was built using:

Frontend: 🎨

HTML5 (Semantic)

CSS3 (Custom Properties, Flexbox, Grid)

JavaScript (ES6+) for all interactivity

Tooling & Libraries: 🔧

ScrollReveal.js: For the smooth, "on-scroll" fade-in animations.

Formspree: As a simple, serverless backend for the AJAX contact form.

Git & GitHub: For version control and deployment via GitHub Pages.

✨ Key Features

Fully Responsive: Looks and works perfectly on all devices, from small mobile screens to large desktops.

Interactive CV Modal: The "View CV" button opens an in-page modal to preview my resume, rather than forcing a download.

AJAX Contact Form: The "Get In Touch" form is powered by a "no-refresh" JavaScript submit. It sends me an email via Formspree, clears the inputs, and provides a "Message Sent!" success state.

Smooth Animations: Subtle "slide-in" animations on page scroll to guide the user's eye and create a polished, modern feel.

Clean Codebase: All files are organized logically. All assets (images, PDFs) are stored in the media folder, and all logic is cleanly separated in script.js.

🚀 Running This Project Locally

Want to run this project on your own machine? It's simple:

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/Nsumithreddy/portfolio-sumith.git](https://github.com/Nsumithreddy/portfolio-sumith.git)


Navigate to the folder:

cd portfolio-sumith


Run a local server:

This project is pure HTML, CSS, and JS. It needs no special build steps.

The easiest way to run it is with a local server extension, like VS Code's "Live Server".

(You can't just open index.html in your browser, as the JavaScript fetch for the contact form will be blocked by browser security (CORS)).
