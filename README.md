✨ Features

Fully Responsive: Looks and works great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.

Interactive CV Modal: The "View CV" button opens a clean, in-page preview of my resume without forcing a download.

AJAX Contact Form: A "no-refresh" contact form (powered by Formspree) that sends me an email, clears the form on success, and gives the user feedback.

Smooth Scroll & Animations: Subtle "slide-in" animations (via ScrollReveal.js) and smooth scrolling for a modern, polished feel.

Organized Code: All assets (images, PDFs) are organized into a media folder, and all JavaScript logic is separated into script.js.

🛠️ Built With
