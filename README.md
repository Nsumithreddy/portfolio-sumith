## About This Project

This project is more than just a resume; it's a practical demonstration of my ability to build a modern, mobile-first website from the ground up. I designed it to be clean, fast, and a true representation of my personal brand: the intersection of clean design and data-driven solutions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This site was built using:

* **Frontend: 🎨**
  * HTML5 (Semantic)
  * CSS3 (Custom Properties, Flexbox, Grid)
  * JavaScript (ES6+) for all interactivity

* **Tooling & Libraries: 🔧**
  * **ScrollReveal.js:** For the smooth, "on-scroll" fade-in animations.
  * **Formspree:** As a simple, serverless backend for the AJAX contact form.
  * **Git & GitHub:** For version control and deployment via GitHub Pages.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Fully Responsive:** Looks and works perfectly on all devices, from small mobile screens to large desktops.

* **Interactive CV Modal:** The "View CV" button opens an in-page modal to preview my resume, rather than forcing a download.

* **AJAX Contact Form:** The "Get In Touch" form is powered by a "no-refresh" JavaScript submit. It sends me an email via Formspree, clears the inputs, and provides a "Message Sent!" success state.

* **Smooth Animations:** Subtle "slide-in" animations on page scroll to guide the user's eye and create a polished, modern feel.

* **Clean Codebase:** All files are organized logically. All assets (images, PDFs) are stored in the `media` folder, and all logic is cleanly separated in `script.js`.

## 🚀 Running This Project Locally

Want to run this project on your own machine? It's simple:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Nsumithreddy/portfolio-sumith.git](https://github.com/Nsumithreddy/portfolio-sumith.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the folder:**
    ```bash
    cd portfolio-sumith
    ```

3.  **Run a local server:**
    * This project is pure HTML, CSS, and JS. It needs no special build steps.
    * The easiest way to run it is with a local server extension, like **VS Code's "Live Server"**.
    * (You can't just open `index.html` in your browser, as the JavaScript `fetch` for the contact form will be blocked by browser security (CORS)).
